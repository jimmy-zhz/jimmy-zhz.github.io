![[regression-line-and-plane.png]]

#### OLS Regression

$$\text{SSR} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

- easy to understand and interpret
- the method doesn't require any tuning
- solution just a calculation
- accuracy can be greatly reduced by outliers

#### Multiple Linear Regression
[MultipleLinearRegression-Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jimmy-zhz/colab-playground/blob/main/1traditional-ml/IBM-1-2-2-MultipleLinearRegression.ipynb)


Features:
- better than simple linear regression
- too many variables can cause overfitting
- To improve prediction, convert categorical independent vars into numerical vars

Application:
- used in education to predict outcomes and explain relationships
- used to predict the impact of changes in "what-if" scenarios

<font style="background-color:orange; color:black">correlation pitfalls</font>
- remove redundant variables
- select vars which are :
	- most understood
	- controllable
	- most correlated with target

Fitting a <font style="background-color:tomato; color:black">hyperplane</font>


<font style="background-color:tomato; color:black">Least Squares Solution</font>
is usually the best solution for standard linear regression.

![[sigmoid-function.png]]


### Module 2 Summary
- Regression models relationships between a continuous target variable and explanatory features, covering simple and multiple regression types.
    
- Simple regression uses a single independent variable to estimate a dependent variable, while multiple regression involves more than one independent variable.
    
- Regression is widely applicable, from forecasting sales and estimating maintenance costs to predicting rainfall and disease spread.
    
- In simple linear regression, a best-fit line minimizes errors, measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE); this approach is known as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).
    
- OLS regression is easy to interpret but sensitive to outliers, which can impact accuracy.
    
- Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression by using multiple variables to predict outcomes and analyze variable relationships.
    
- Adding too many variables can lead to overfitting, so careful variable selection is necessary to build a balanced model.
    
- Nonlinear regression models complex relationships using polynomial, exponential, or logarithmic functions when data does not fit a straight line.
    
- Polynomial regression can fit data but mayoverfit by capturing random noise rather than underlying patterns.
    
- Logistic regression is a probability predictor and binary classifier, suitable for binary targets and assessing feature impact.
    
- Logistic regression minimizes errors using log-loss and optimizes with gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent for efficiency.
    
- Gradient descent is an iterative process to minimize the cost function, which is crucial for training logistic regression models.

- Classification is a supervised machine learning method used to predict labels on new data with applications in churn prediction, customer segmentation, loan default prediction, and multiclass drug prescriptions.
    
- Binary classifiers can be extended to multiclass classification using one-versus-all or one-versus-one strategies.
    
- A decision tree classifies data by testing features at each node, branching based on test results, and assigning classes at leaf nodes.
    
- Decision tree training involves selecting features that best split the data and pruning the tree to avoid overfitting.
    
- Information gain and Gini impurity are used to measure the quality of splits in decision trees.
    
- Regression trees are similar to decision trees but predict continuous values by recursively splitting data to maximize information gain.
    
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure split quality in regression trees.
    
- K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a supervised algorithm used for classification and regression by assigning labels based on the closest labeled data points.
    
- To optimize k-NN, test various k values and measure accuracy, considering class distribution and feature relevance.
    
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) build classifiers by finding a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes, effective in high-dimensional spaces but sensitive to noise and large datasets.
    
- The bias-variance tradeoff affects model accuracy, and methods such as bagging, boosting, and random forests help manage bias and variance to improve model performance.
    
- Random forests use bagging to train multiple decision trees on bootstrapped data, improving accuracy by reducing variance.

## M4: Building Unsupervised Learning Models

### Summary
- Clustering is a machine learning technique used to group data based on similarity, with applications in customer segmentation and anomaly detection.
    
- K-means clustering partitions data into clusters based on the distance between data points and centroids but struggles with imbalanced or non-convex clusters.

## M5:  Evaluating and Validating Machine Learning Models

### Summary
- Supervised learning evaluation assesses a model's ability to predict outcomes for unseen data, often using a train/test split to estimate performance.
    
- Key metrics for classification evaluation include accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and the F1 score, which balances precision and recall.
    
- Regression model evaluation metrics include MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared, and explained variance to measure prediction accuracy.
    
- Unsupervised learning models are evaluated for pattern quality and consistency using metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Adjusted Rand Index.
    
- Dimensionality reduction evaluation involves Explained Variance Ratio, Reconstruction Error, and Neighborhood Preservation to assess data structure retention.
    
- Model validation, including dividing data into training, validation, and test sets, helps prevent overfitting by tuning hyperparameters carefully.
    
- Cross-validation methods, especially K-fold and stratified cross-validation, support robust model validation without overfitting to test data.
    
- Regularization techniques, such as ridge (L2) and lasso (L1) regression, help prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms to linear regression models.
    
- Data leakage occurs when training data includes information unavailable in real-world data, which is preventable by separating data properly and mindful feature selection.
    
- Common modeling pitfalls include misinterpreting feature importance, ignoring class imbalance, and relying excessively on automated processes without causal analysis.
    
- Feature importance assessments should consider redundancy, scale sensitivity, and avoid misinterpretation, as well as inappropriate assumptions about causation.
